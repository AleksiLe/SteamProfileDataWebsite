# SteamProfileWebProject V1.0

## Python extensions and running the project

Flask and SQLAlchemy were used on this project. You can install them with pip using the following command.
```
$ pip install -U Flask-SQLAlchemy
```
After that, you can run the main file which starts the server.
```
$ python3 main.py
```
You see from the command line in which addresses the server started and by going to that address from a browser you can access the webpage.
## Future

Perhaps login for users to study that area or get more data from steam's API. The visual presentation needs upgrade at least.
